# Day 1: Adding Cache and Mobile Detection

Today, I worked on my side project, [Name Checker](https://namechecker.leandrosf.com). Here's a summary of the updates:

## Cache Implementation
I implemented caching to improve the performance and responsiveness of the site. This will help reduce the load time and save bandwidth, especially for repeat visitors.

## Mobile Detection
Added mobile detection to ensure the site is user-friendly and responsive on mobile devices. This will help in adjusting the layout and functionalities to suit mobile users.

## Repository Setup
I also set up this repository to track my progress throughout the #100DaysOfCode challenge. This will serve as a log of my daily activities and achievements.
