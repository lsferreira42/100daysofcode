# Day 2: Developing Key-Value Store

[Link to the code](https://github.com/lsferreira42/nadb)

Today was dedicated to working on a simple key-value store named NADB (Not A Database) as part of a side project. Below is a summary of the work done:

## Key-Value Store Development
Initiated the development of a basic key-value store named NADB. The store is designed to be thread-safe with asynchronous disk buffering features. This educational project aims to provide a better understanding of data management and retrieval.

## Asynchronous Disk Buffering
Implemented asynchronous disk buffering to ensure data is written to disk in a non-blocking manner. This feature aims to improve the performance and scalability of the key-value store.

## Error Handling and Logging
Added a basic error handling and logging mechanism to track operations and handle unexpected scenarios gracefully. This basic error handling is essential for future debugging and maintenance.

## Packaging and Distribution
Worked on packaging the project and preparing it for distribution. Although this is an educational project and not intended for production use, packaging it properly provided insights into how Python projects are structured and distributed.

## Reflection
Working on the key-value store was a practical exercise in managing data efficiently and understanding the basics of asynchronous operations in Python. The journey from concept to packaging was informative and sets a good precedent for the upcoming days of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.
